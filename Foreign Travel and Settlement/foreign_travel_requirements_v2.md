## Key Interpretation Rules

### Travel Houses
- 3rd House → Short journeys
- 7th House → Business / contractual travel
- 9th House → Long-distance / foreign travel
- 12th House → Foreign residence / separation

---

## Emotional vs Physical Settlement (CRITICAL)

The system MUST separate **emotional attachment** from **physical residence**.

### Emotional Anchoring Indicators
- Strong Moon (own sign / exalted)
- Strong 4th house or its lord
- Moon connected to Cancer / Taurus

Indicates:
- Nostalgia
- Cultural bonding
- Emotional attachment to homeland

⚠️ Emotional attachment ≠ physical return.

---

### Physical Settlement Indicators
Permanent settlement abroad is indicated if **2 or more** apply:
- Lagna lord linked to 12th house
- Rahu in Lagna or 12th
- Saturn strongly influencing Lagna or 12th
- Long Rahu or Saturn Mahadasha during migration
- 10+ years continuous foreign residence

If present:
→ Verdict = **Physically Settled Abroad**
(Even if emotional attachment remains strong)

---

## Dasha Logic

### Rahu Mahadasha
- Identity shift
- Foreign anchoring
- Irreversible moves

### Saturn Mahadasha
- Long-term residence
- Consolidation and permanence

### Jupiter Mahadasha
- Travel, education
- Settlement only with physical indicators

---

## Validation Rule

- They override weak theoretical indicators
