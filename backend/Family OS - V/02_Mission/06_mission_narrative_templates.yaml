    high_alignment:
      condition:

        execution_readiness: immediate_action
      tone: confident_responsible
      template: >
        This family carries a clear and actionable karmic mission.
        There is a strong obligation toward visible work, sustained responsibility,
        and meaningful contribution to society.
        Mission fulfillment requires disciplined execution, ethical conduct,
        and acceptance of leadership or service-oriented roles.
        Avoid spiritual bypassing or postponement of duties under the guise of detachment.

    strong_but_delayed:
      condition:
        mission_vector_score: ">=75"
        execution_readiness: phased_execution
      tone: patient_structured
      template: >
        The karmic mission of this family is strong, but its execution
        unfolds in stages rather than immediate results.
        Persistence, long-term planning, and respect for timing are essential.
        Delays are not denial; they are part of karmic maturation.
        Premature force or frustration may weaken outcomes.

    mixed_alignment:
      condition:
        mission_vector_score: "50–74"
      tone: corrective_guiding
      template: >
        This family holds a partially defined mission.
        Competing responsibilities or unclear role distribution may dilute impact.
        Mission success depends on conscious role clarity,
        realistic goal-setting, and avoidance of internal comparison or resentment.
        Progress is achieved through cooperation rather than individual dominance.

    preparatory_phase:
      condition:
        mission_vector_score: "30–49"
      tone: stabilizing_instructional
      template: >
        This phase of life emphasizes preparation rather than execution.
        The immediate mission is to stabilize routines, build skills,
        and resolve internal or structural weaknesses.
        External contribution will naturally arise once foundational discipline
        and confidence are established.

    low_alignment:
      condition:
        mission_vector_score: "<30"
      tone: cautionary_supportive
      template: >
        The family is undergoing karmic recalibration.
        Pressing for achievement or social validation may lead to exhaustion or conflict.
        The true mission at this stage is healing, simplification,
        and release of inherited burdens that obstruct sustainable action.

  execution_risk_warnings:

    burnout_risk:
      trigger:
        risk_pattern: burnout
      message: >
        There is a tendency to overextend effort without adequate recovery.
        Sustainable mission fulfillment requires pacing,
        delegation, and respect for physical and emotional limits.

    authority_conflict:
      trigger:
        risk_pattern: authority_conflict
      message: >
        Power struggles or unclear leadership may undermine mission outcomes.
        Clear responsibility boundaries and respectful decision frameworks are advised.

    ethical_drift:
      trigger:
        risk_pattern: ethical_compromise
      message: >
        Short-term gains achieved through compromised values
        may weaken long-term karmic returns.
        Re-alignment with ethical principles is necessary for mission stability.

  reinforcement_messages:

    saturn_supported:
      trigger:
        planet: Saturn
        strength: strong
      message: >
        Saturnian support indicates that patience, discipline,
        and long-term responsibility are key allies in fulfilling the family mission.

    jupiter_supported:
      trigger:
        planet: Jupiter
        strength: strong
      message: >
        Jupiterian influence supports ethical expansion,
        teaching, guidance, and value-based leadership within the mission framework.

    mars_supported:
      trigger:
        planet: Mars
        strength: strong
      message: >
        Mars provides the courage and initiative required
        to act decisively when mission clarity is present.
        Action must remain aligned with restraint and wisdom.
