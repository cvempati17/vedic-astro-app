    purpose: "Defines planetary authority and chart pathways for Mission execution"
    design_principle: >
      Mission is action under karma.
      Vision chooses direction.
      Mission chooses effort, sacrifice, discipline, and execution.
      Mission succeeds only when will (Mars) and endurance (Saturn)
      are aligned with purpose (Sun) and logic (Mercury).
