    layer: free_will_intervention
    purpose: >
      Defines conscious intervention pathways that allow the family
      to alter mission outcomes, reduce suffering, and redirect effort
      without violating karmic structure or timing.

  philosophical_position:
    - Karma defines constraints, not compulsion
    - Free will operates through choice of response and pacing
    - Intervention changes trajectory, not destiny category
    - Conscious reduction of load is a valid karmic act
    - Acceptance and action are both interventions

  intervention_modes:

    mitigation:
      description: >
        Reduces intensity, friction, or suffering
        without attempting to override karmic themes.
      examples:
        - load_reduction
        - pacing_adjustment
        - emotional_boundary_setting

    redirection:
      description: >
        Channels mission energy into alternate,
        more sustainable expressions.
      examples:
        - role_reassignment
        - scope_redefinition
        - value_realignment

    amplification:
      description: >
        Strengthens favorable conditions
        when timing and capacity support it.
      examples:
        - responsibility_expansion
        - visibility_increase
        - leadership_assumption

    acceptance:
      description: >
        Conscious non-action or endurance
        when intervention would increase harm.
      examples:
        - honoring_delay
        - rest_cycles
        - surrender_of_control

    - This layer provides guidance, not obligation
    - Outputs must be framed as options, not commands
