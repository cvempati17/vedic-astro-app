    purpose: >
      Detects, explains, and resolves conflicts between
      family Vision (identity, values, long-term direction)
      and Mission (action, responsibility, execution load),
      ensuring philosophical alignment does not degrade
      operational sustainability.
    dependency_files:

      - vision_narrative_templates.yaml
      - mission_engine.yaml
      - mission_narrative_templates.yaml
      - 08_mission_responsibility_distribution.yaml

  governing_assumptions:
    - Vision defines meaning; Mission defines action
    - Neither Vision nor Mission is superior in isolation
    - Long-term incoherence manifests as burnout, guilt, or stagnation
    - Resolution favors recalibration over abandonment

    value_execution_alignment:
      description: >
        Measures whether daily actions support
        stated family values and philosophy.
      indicators:

        - ethical_drift_under_pressure
        - symbolic_vision_without_practice

    identity_load_alignment:
      description: >
        Evaluates whether execution demands
        exceed what the family identity can sustainably carry.
      indicators:
        - mission_load_exceeds_identity_capacity
        - role_enforcement_against_nature
        - forced_responsibility_adoption

    time_horizon_alignment:
      description: >
        Ensures short-term mission goals
        do not sabotage long-term vision.

        - impatience_against_lifecycle
        - premature_scaling

    emotional_integrity_alignment:
      description: >
        Assesses emotional coherence between
        meaning and effort.

      condition:
        vision_clarity_score: ">=75"
        mission_vector_score: "<50"
      classification: symbolic_overreach
      explanation: >
        The family clearly knows who it wants to be,
        but current structures do not support execution.
        Pressure to act may create guilt or self-judgment.

    vision_weak_mission_strong:
      condition:
        vision_clarity_score: "<50"
        mission_vector_score: ">=75"
      classification: mechanical_life_pattern
      explanation: >
        The family is highly active and responsible,
        but lacks a shared sense of meaning or direction.
        This risks burnout or existential dissatisfaction.

    values_misaligned_execution:
      condition:
        value_execution_alignment: misaligned
      classification: ethical_tension
      explanation: >
        Actions taken to fulfill mission
        are drifting away from core values,
        weakening long-term coherence.

    overload_against_identity:
      condition:
        identity_load_alignment: misaligned
      classification: identity_violation
      explanation: >
        Mission demands exceed what the family’s
        identity and emotional architecture can sustain.

  resolution_strategies:

    symbolic_overreach:
      primary_action:
        - reduce_mission_scope
        - strengthen_execution_support
      guidance: >
        Ground vision through small, consistent actions.
        Avoid self-criticism for slow progress.

    mechanical_life_pattern:
      primary_action:
        - revisit_family_vision
        - articulate_shared_meaning
      guidance: >
        Pause expansion.
        Clarify why the family is doing what it is doing.

    ethical_tension:
      primary_action:
        - realign_decisions_with_values
        - adjust_success_metrics
      guidance: >
        Long-term stability requires ethical congruence,
        even at the cost of short-term efficiency.

    identity_violation:
      primary_action:
        - redistribute_responsibilities
        - release_nonessential_obligations
      guidance: >
        Mission must serve identity,
        not overwrite it.

      message: >
        Repeated incoherence indicates
        structural misalignment.
        Continuing without correction
        will compound long-term damage.

  enforcement_rules:
    - Vision must not be used to justify suffering
    - Mission must not ignore emotional signals
    - Coherence resolution overrides expansion goals
    - Sustained incoherence is treated as a system fault

  usage_constraints:
    - Resolver does not modify Vision or Mission data directly
    - Outputs are advisory but must be surfaced prominently
    - Language must avoid blame and moralization
