    purpose: >
      Models how the family mission evolves across Mahā-Daśā periods,
      ensuring that responsibility, execution expectations, and load
      distribution remain appropriate to time, capacity, and karmic phase.

      - 08_mission_responsibility_distribution.yaml
      - 09_mission_vision_coherence_resolver.yaml

  governing_principles:
    - Mission is time-sensitive, not static
    - Each Mahā-Daśā permits only certain forms of execution
    - Pressure applied outside dasha compatibility causes failure
    - Expansion phases must follow consolidation phases
    - Responsibility must ebb and flow with karmic timing

    execution_capacity_bands:
      expansion:
        description: >
          Periods favorable for growth, visibility,
          responsibility increase, and outward contribution.
      consolidation:
        description: >
          Periods for stabilizing gains, refining systems,
          and protecting what has been built.
      corrective:
        description: >
          Periods requiring repair, restructuring,
          or ethical realignment.
      withdrawal:
        description: >
          Periods emphasizing rest, healing,
          learning, or reduced outward obligation.

  dasha_transition_protocols:

    entry_phase:
      guidance: >
        First 6–12 months require observation
        before adjusting mission load aggressively.

    mid_phase:
      guidance: >
        Core execution patterns stabilize.
        Fine-tune responsibility distribution.

    exit_phase:
      guidance: >
        Gradually unwind incompatible responsibilities
        and prepare for next dasha mode.

  enforcement_rules:
    - Dasha mode overrides ambition
    - Expansion without timing support is invalid
    - Withdrawal phases must be honored
    - Chronic violation leads to coherence escalation

  usage_constraints:
    - This layer must not alter Vision definitions
    - Outputs must flow into responsibility_distribution
    - Language must normalize change, not frame it as failure
