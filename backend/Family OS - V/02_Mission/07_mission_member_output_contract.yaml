mission_member_output_contract:

  metadata:
    module: mission
    layer: member_output_contract
    purpose: >
      Defines how the family-level mission is translated into
      role-specific execution responsibilities, capacity limits,
      failure modes, and corrective guidance for each family member.

  governing_principles:
    - Mission is expressed through action, not identity
    - No single member carries the entire mission load
    - Execution must remain sustainable across life phases
    - Responsibility must scale with capacity and life stage
    - Correction is preferable to endurance-based suffering

        All members are expected to actively participate
        within their defined domains while respecting capacity limits.

        Role clarity and boundary enforcement are critical.
        Overcompensation by any one member must be avoided.

      condition:

      guidance: >
        Reduce execution pressure.
        Prioritize stabilization, healing, and gradual re-engagement.

  enforcement_rules:
    - No member may be assigned responsibility beyond capacity
    - Role corrections must precede redistribution
    - Endurance without correction is a failure condition
    - Mission success is collective, not individual

  usage_constraints:
    - This layer must not introduce new astrological logic
    - Language must remain non-fatalistic and adaptive
    - Guidance must support sustainability over achievement
