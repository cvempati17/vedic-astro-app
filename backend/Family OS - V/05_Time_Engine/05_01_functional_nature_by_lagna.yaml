    Defines functional nature of planets per Lagna.
    This file determines beneficence, maleficence,
    and yogakaraka status for Dasha intensity computation.
  rules:
    - Kendrādhipati dosha applied
    - Trik lords treated as functional malefics
    - Yogakaraka only when ruling Kendra + Trikona
    - Moon beneficence depends on lordship only (no paksha here)
