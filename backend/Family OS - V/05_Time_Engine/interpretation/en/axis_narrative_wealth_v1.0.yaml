  title: "Wealth & Resource Stability"

    short: >
      How resources, income flow, and material stability evolve through time.

    medium: >
      Wealth describes how a person acquires, manages, and sustains resources
      over time. This axis reflects income flow, savings behavior, financial
      responsibility, and the capacity to build material stability.
      It does not measure luxury, lifestyle, or comparison with others.
      Instead, it shows when resource-building is supported, when caution
      is required, and when consolidation is more important than expansion.

    long: >
      Wealth represents the timing and sustainability of material resources.
      It reflects how income, assets, and financial responsibility develop
      through effort, discipline, and opportunity across different life phases.
      
      This axis is not a promise of riches, nor a judgment of financial worth.
      High wealth potential does not guarantee abundance, and restrictive
      phases do not imply permanent limitation. Instead, this axis shows
      when financial actions are more likely to stabilize, grow, or require
      restraint.
      
      Wealth timing often moves in cycles. Periods of accumulation may be
      followed by phases that demand prudence, restructuring, or patience.
      Expansion without readiness can create strain, just as caution during
      supportive phases can limit growth.
      
      Reading this axis helps align financial decisions with timing —
      identifying when to invest, when to preserve, and when to focus
      on strengthening the foundation rather than increasing scale.
