      How values, responsibility, and long-term impact carry forward over time.

    medium: >
      Legacy describes how actions, decisions, and values extend beyond
      immediate outcomes and influence the future.
      This axis reflects continuity, stewardship, and the transmission
      of responsibility, culture, or stability to the next phase or generation.
      It does not measure fame, recognition, or remembrance,
      but shows how lasting impact is built gradually through consistency
      and long-term orientation.

    long: >
      Legacy represents the relationship between present effort and future
      continuity. It reflects how values, structures, and responsibilities
      are sustained, transferred, or reshaped over time.
      This may express through family systems, institutions, work created,
      or the example set through conduct and decision-making.
      
      This axis is not a promise of permanence or recognition.
      High legacy intensity does not guarantee lasting results,
      and quieter phases do not imply absence of impact.
      Instead, it reflects timing — when long-term thinking is required,
      when foundations are tested, and when patient stewardship
      matters more than immediate visibility.
      
      Legacy often develops slowly. Some phases emphasize maintenance,
      repair, and responsibility for what already exists,
      while others allow renewal, handover, or redefinition of direction.
      Forcing legacy during unstable periods can weaken continuity,
      just as neglect during supportive phases can erode what has been built.
      
      Reading this axis helps align choices with long-term consequences —
      recognizing when to preserve, when to adapt,
      and when consistent effort quietly shapes outcomes
      that extend beyond the present moment.
