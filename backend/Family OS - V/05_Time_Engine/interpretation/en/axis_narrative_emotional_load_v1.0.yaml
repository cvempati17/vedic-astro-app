  title: "Emotional Load, Stress & Inner Carrying Capacity"

  description:
    short: >
      How emotional pressure, stress, and inner responsibility accumulate over time.

    medium: >
      Emotional Load describes the amount of emotional pressure,
      mental responsibility, and internal strain a person carries.
      This axis reflects stress, emotional duty, and the weight of
      unspoken responsibility within family and personal life.
      It does not measure emotional strength or weakness,
      but shows how much is being carried internally at different times.

    long: >
      Emotional Load represents the accumulation of stress, responsibility,
      and emotional holding that is often invisible to others.
      It reflects the inner demands created by caregiving, leadership,
      unresolved tension, expectations, or prolonged responsibility.
      
      This axis is not a judgment of resilience or coping ability.
      High emotional load does not imply fragility,
      and low emotional load does not imply detachment.
      Instead, it reflects timing — when emotional demands intensify,
      when pressure builds quietly, and when inner resources are stretched.
      
      Emotional load often rises during periods of sustained responsibility,
      delayed resolution, or prolonged endurance.
      Some phases require holding space for others while managing
      one’s own uncertainty or fatigue.
      Other phases allow release, recovery, and redistribution of pressure.
      
      Reading this axis helps recognize when rest, boundaries,
      or support are necessary — and when emotional capacity
      can be used constructively without leading to exhaustion.
      Its purpose is awareness, not alarm,
      enabling sustainable engagement rather than silent overload.
