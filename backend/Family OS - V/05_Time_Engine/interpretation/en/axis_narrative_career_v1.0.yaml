      How work, responsibility, and contribution express through time.

      Career describes how a person applies skill, effort, and responsibility
      in the outer world. It reflects contribution, role, accountability,
      and visibility over time. This axis does not measure job titles,
      salary, or status. Instead, it shows when effort can translate
      into responsibility and recognition, and when progress requires
      patience and consolidation.

    long: >
      Career represents the evolving relationship between effort and responsibility.
      It describes how a person engages with work, leadership, accountability,
      and public contribution across different phases of life.
      
      This axis is not a judgment of success or failure. It does not promise
      position, income, or recognition. Instead, it reflects timing:
      when responsibility increases, when effort feels heavy,
      when results are delayed, and when action can translate more
      smoothly into outcomes.
      
      Career timing often unfolds unevenly. Periods of visible progress
      may alternate with phases of consolidation, endurance, or preparation.
      A restrictive phase does not mean absence of ability,
      just as an open phase does not guarantee ease.
      
      Reading this axis requires patience. Its purpose is to help align
      effort with timing — to know when to act, when to prepare,
      and when persistence matters more than immediate reward.
