    short: >
      How disagreement, tension, and resolution evolve over time.

    medium: >
      Conflict describes how tension, disagreement, and differing needs
      surface and are managed within relationships.
      This axis reflects the capacity to handle friction, express boundaries,
      and restore balance after disruption.
      It does not measure anger, blame, or fault,
      but shows when conflicts are more likely to arise
      and how manageable they may feel over time.

    long: >
      Conflict represents the natural emergence of differences, pressure,
      and opposing perspectives within close relationships and family systems.
      It reflects how tension is expressed, contained, and resolved —
      whether through dialogue, avoidance, endurance, or repair.
      
      This axis is not a judgment of character or emotional maturity.
      Higher conflict intensity does not imply wrongdoing or failure,
      just as lower intensity does not guarantee harmony.
      Instead, it reflects timing — when pressures are more likely to surface,
      when patience is tested, and when resolution requires greater effort.
      
      Conflict often appears during periods of transition, responsibility shifts,
      or unmet expectations. Some phases demand careful communication
      and boundary awareness, while others allow easier reconciliation
      and mutual understanding.
      
      Reading this axis helps align responses to tension with timing —
      recognizing when to engage directly, when to pause,
      and when structured repair is more effective than immediate reaction.
      Its purpose is not to avoid conflict,
      but to navigate it without long-term damage to trust or stability.
