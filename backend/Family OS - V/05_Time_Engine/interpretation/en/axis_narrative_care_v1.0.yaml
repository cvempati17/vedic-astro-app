      How care, responsibility for others, and emotional support unfold over time.

    medium: >
      Care describes how a person gives, receives, and sustains emotional
      and practical support within family and close relationships.
      This axis reflects nurturing capacity, responsibility toward dependents,
      and the ability to provide stability and reassurance.
      It does not measure sacrifice, obligation, or moral duty,
      but shows how caregiving energy flows and changes with time.

    long: >
      Care represents the evolving capacity to nurture, support, and hold space
      for others across different life phases. It includes emotional presence,
      attentiveness, and practical responsibility toward family members,
      children, elders, or those who depend on stability and reassurance.
      
      This axis is not a measure of love, virtue, or selflessness.
      High care intensity does not require constant giving,
      and lower intensity does not imply neglect or absence of concern.
      Instead, it reflects timing — when caregiving demands increase,
      when emotional availability is tested,
      and when balance between self-care and responsibility is essential.
      
      Care often moves in cycles. Periods of high demand may require endurance,
      structure, and boundaries, while quieter phases allow recovery,
      rebalancing, and restoration. Overextending during demanding phases
      can lead to exhaustion, just as disengaging during supportive phases
      can weaken connection.
      
      Reading this axis helps align nurturing effort with timing —
      recognizing when to step in, when to share responsibility,
      and when preserving one’s own stability is necessary
      to sustain care over the long term.
