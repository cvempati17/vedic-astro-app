description: >
  Defines axis-specific sensitivity modifiers that determine how strongly
  HIGH Emotional Risk suppresses expansion (OPEN) for each life axis.
  This file provides interpretive weighting only.
  It must not redefine Emotional Risk scores, thresholds, or phase logic.

# ---------------------------------------------------
# CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
# ---------------------------------------------------

principles:
  - Emotional Risk thresholds are global and invariant
  - Axis modifiers adjust sensitivity, not risk level
  - Modifiers affect OPEN suppression only
  - Modifiers must never create BLOCK phases
  - All modifiers must be explainable in plain language

# ---------------------------------------------------
# MODIFIER SCALE (LOCKED)
# ---------------------------------------------------

modifier_scale:
  high_sensitivity: 1.2   # Emotionally sensitive axis
  neutral: 1.0            # Default sensitivity
  resilient: 0.8          # Emotionally resilient axis

allowed_values:
  - 0.8
  - 1.0
  - 1.2

# ---------------------------------------------------

axis_modifiers:

  CAREER_PUBLIC_CONTRIBUTION:
    modifier: 0.8
    sensitivity_band: "RESILIENT"
    rationale: >
      Career execution tolerates emotional load better than
      interpersonal domains. Elevated emotional risk may
      slow expansion, but does not immediately destabilize
      outward contribution or responsibility.

  RELATIONSHIPS_PARTNERSHIP:
    modifier: 1.2
    sensitivity_band: "HIGH"
    rationale: >
      Relationship dynamics are highly sensitive to emotional
      volatility. Elevated emotional risk strongly suppresses
      expansion to prevent instability or misalignment.

  FAMILY_DYNAMICS:
    modifier: 1.1
    sensitivity_band: "MODERATE_HIGH"
    rationale: >
      Family systems are moderately sensitive to emotional
      instability, especially during periods of change or
      role redefinition.

  HEALTH_WELLBEING:
    modifier: 1.2
    sensitivity_band: "HIGH"
    rationale: >
      Emotional volatility directly impacts wellbeing and
      recovery. Stronger safety gating is required before
      allowing expansion on this axis.

  WEALTH_MATERIAL_SECURITY:
    modifier: 0.9
    sensitivity_band: "MODERATE_LOW"
    rationale: >
      Financial systems can tolerate emotional stress when
      structure is present, though prolonged volatility
      still warrants caution.

# ---------------------------------------------------
# APPLICATION RULES (AUTHORITATIVE)
# ---------------------------------------------------

application:
  applies_only_when:
    emotional_risk_level: "HIGH"

  affects:
    - open_suppression_strictness

  never_affects:
    - emotional_risk_score
    - emotional_risk_thresholds
    - intensity_values
    - block_hold_resolution
    - family_level_distribution

notes: >
  Axis modifiers influence how conservatively the system
  suppresses OPEN under HIGH Emotional Risk.
  Suppression remains binary (OPEN suppressed or not).
  No fractional phases or probabilities are permitted.

# TRACE & UI SEMANTICS
# ---------------------------------------------------

trace_semantics:
  show_axis_sensitivity: true
  copy_templates:

    high_sensitivity: >
      This axis is highly sensitive to emotional volatility.
      Elevated emotional risk more strongly suppresses
      expansion to protect stability.

    moderate_sensitivity: >
      This axis has moderate sensitivity to emotional
      volatility. Safety considerations apply during
      elevated emotional risk.

    resilient: >
      This axis is relatively resilient to emotional load.
      Elevated emotional risk has a weaker suppressive
      effect on expansion.

# ---------------------------------------------------
# NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
# ---------------------------------------------------

constraints:
  - Modifiers must not be recalculated dynamically
  - Frontend must not interpret numeric modifier values
  - All explanations must be sourced from this file
  - Adding a new axis requires MAJOR version bump
