description: >
  Defines canonical semantic meaning, behavioral guidance, and
  user-facing explanations for life-axis phases: BLOCK, HOLD, and OPEN.
  This file contains interpretation only.
  No thresholds, calculations, or temporal logic are permitted.

# IMPORTANT:
# Phase meanings are invariant across time and life axes.
# Any contradiction must be resolved in logic layers,
# not by redefining these semantics.

# PHASE DEFINITIONS
# ---------------------------------------------------

phases:

  FM_PHASE_BLOCK:
    label: "BLOCK"

    short_explanation: >
      Conditions resist execution. Effort does not convert efficiently
      into visible or lasting outcomes.

    long_explanation: >
      BLOCK represents a timing-based restriction, not a lack of ability
      or potential. The environment is not ready to receive or reward
      effort on this axis. External resistance, delays, or misalignment
      are likely if outcomes are forced. This phase favors preparation,
      consolidation, and internal alignment rather than visible action.

    interpretation_notes:
      - BLOCK does not mean failure.
      - BLOCK does not mean inactivity.
      - BLOCK indicates low return on outward effort.

    behavioral_guidance:
      focus_on:
        - skill building
        - learning and preparation
        - structural planning
        - emotional regulation
      avoid:
        - forcing outcomes
        - high-risk commitments
        - premature launches
        - emotional overinvestment

    mindset_reframe: >
      This is a loading phase. What is built internally now
      becomes usable later when conditions open.

    ui:
      color: "purple"
      icon: "lock"
      emphasis_level: "high"

  # ---------------------------------------------------

  FM_PHASE_HOLD:
    label: "HOLD"

    short_explanation: >
      Stable but non-expansive conditions. Progress is possible,
      but growth is incremental.

    long_explanation: >
      HOLD represents a usable but contained period. Effort produces
      results in proportion to discipline and consistency, but major
      breakthroughs or rapid expansion are unlikely. This phase rewards
      reliability, responsibility, and steady execution rather than
      aggressive scaling.

    interpretation_notes:
      - HOLD is neutral, not negative.
      - HOLD supports maintenance and credibility.
      - HOLD favors patience over acceleration.

    behavioral_guidance:
      focus_on:
        - consistent execution
        - reliability and follow-through
        - system and habit building
        - reputation strengthening
      avoid:
        - impatience
        - over-scaling
        - unnecessary risk-taking

    mindset_reframe: >
      This is a stabilizing phase. What is maintained and refined
      here becomes the foundation for later expansion.

    ui:
      color: "brown"
      icon: "pause"
      emphasis_level: "medium"

  # ---------------------------------------------------

  FM_PHASE_OPEN:
    label: "OPEN"

    short_explanation: >
      Conditions actively support execution, visibility, and growth.

    long_explanation: >
      OPEN represents alignment between personal capability and external
      opportunity. Effort compounds, visibility increases, and strategic
      risks are more likely to be rewarded. This phase supports leadership,
      initiative, and outward contribution. However, OPEN does not remove
      the need for judgment or discipline.

    interpretation_notes:
      - OPEN amplifies effort but does not replace responsibility.
      - OPEN is conditional and time-bound.
      - OPEN should be used intentionally, not impulsively.

    behavioral_guidance:
      focus_on:
        - launches and initiatives
        - leadership and visibility
        - scaling and expansion
        - strategic risk-taking
      avoid:
        - hesitation
        - underutilizing capability
        - excessive caution

    mindset_reframe: >
      This is an opportunity phase. What is initiated now
      has a higher chance of traction and recognition.

# GLOBAL SEMANTIC GUARDAILS
# ---------------------------------------------------

semantic_rules:
  - Phase meanings must not vary by axis or time.
  - UI text must be sourced directly from this file.
  - No module may override or reinterpret phase meaning locally.
  - Behavioral guidance is advisory, not prescriptive.
