  Defines canonical semantics, explanatory copy, and interpretation
  templates for family-level phase comparison.
  This file provides contextual meaning only and must not introduce
  aggregation logic, thresholds, or phase resolution rules.

# ---------------------------------------------------
# CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
# ---------------------------------------------------

principles:
  - Family comparison is contextual, not diagnostic
  - Individual phases remain authoritative
  - No family-wide phase label is permitted
  - Distribution must never be averaged or scored
  - Comparison must never imply hierarchy or judgment

# ---------------------------------------------------
# VIEW HEADER SEMANTICS
# ---------------------------------------------------

header:
  title: "Family-Level Phase Comparison"
  subtitle_template: >
    Axis: {{axis_label}} · Period: {{period_label}}

  description: >
    This view shows how the same phase category appears
    across family members for the selected period.

# ---------------------------------------------------
# PHASE DISTRIBUTION SEMANTICS
# ---------------------------------------------------

distribution:
  section_title: "Phase Distribution"

  description: >
    This distribution shows how different execution
    conditions are currently expressed across family
    members. It reflects timing context, not effort
    or personal capability.

  phase_labels:
    BLOCK: "BLOCK"
    HOLD: "HOLD"
    OPEN: "OPEN"

# ---------------------------------------------------
# CURRENT MEMBER POSITION
# ---------------------------------------------------

current_member:
  label: "You are here"

  position_templates:
    in_block: >
      This places you within the BLOCK group for this
      axis and period.

    in_hold: >
      This places you within the middle of the family
      distribution for this axis and period.

    in_open: >
      This places you within the OPEN group for this
      axis and period.

# ---------------------------------------------------
# DISTRIBUTION INTERPRETATION TEMPLATES
# ---------------------------------------------------

distribution_interpretation:

  mixed_distribution:
    condition: "multiple_phases_present"
    template: >
      Different family members are experiencing different
      execution conditions. This suggests individualized
      timing rather than a shared family-wide phase.

  majority_block:
    condition: "block_majority"
    template: >
      Multiple family members are in BLOCK phases. This
      indicates broader environmental resistance affecting
      the family during this period.

  majority_hold:
    condition: "hold_majority"
    template: >
      Most family members are in HOLD phases. This suggests
      a period focused on stability, maintenance, and
      steady execution across the family.

  majority_open:
    condition: "open_majority"
    template: >
      Several family members are in OPEN phases. This
      suggests supportive conditions across the family,
      though individual experiences still vary.

# ---------------------------------------------------
# EMOTIONAL RISK CONTEXT (OPTIONAL OVERLAY)
# ---------------------------------------------------

emotional_risk_context:
  section_title: "Emotional Risk Context"

  trigger_condition: "high_risk_count >= 2"

  template: >
    Elevated emotional risk is present for multiple family
    members. Expansion suppression may be observed across
    individual charts during this period.

  disclaimer: >
    Emotional Risk affects expansion permission only and
    does not create BLOCK phases.

# SAFETY & GOVERNANCE FOOTERS

footers:

  independence_disclaimer: >
    Family-level comparison provides contextual insight only.
    Each member’s phase is evaluated independently.

  non_judgment_disclaimer: >
    Phase differences reflect timing and conditions,
    not personal merit, effort, or value.
