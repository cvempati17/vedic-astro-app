    paragraphs:
      - |
        This family carries a deeply dharmic and emotionally rooted vision, centered on emotional security, moral integrity, and inner growth rather than outward dominance or material ambition alone.
      - |
        Alignment is present but requires conscious participation, especially as individual needs and expressions evolve.

# 1A. FAMILY VISION — COMBINED VARIANTS
# ==================================================

family_vision_combined_variants:

  clarity_moderate__parent_dominant:
    template_key: FAMILY_VISION_MODERATE_PARENT_DOMINANT
    text: |
      While a shared vision exists, parental stabilization outweighs the child’s evolving expression, creating a need for conscious handoff rather than prolonged containment.

  clarity_moderate__child_conflicted:
    template_key: FAMILY_VISION_MODERATE_CHILD_CONFLICTED
    text: |
      The family’s vision is present but strained by tension between inherited expectations and the child’s emerging autonomy.

  clarity_low__emotional_overfunctioning:
    template_key: FAMILY_VISION_LOW_EMOTIONAL_OVERFUNCTIONING
    text: |
      Emotional effort temporarily substitutes for shared clarity, masking deeper misalignment within the family vision.

# ==================================================
# 2. FATHER — VISION ROLE
# ==================================================

father_vision_role:
  archetype_label: "Principle Holder & Moral Compass"

  role_description:
    template_key: FATHER_ROLE_BASE
    text: |
      The father’s vision role is to act as a steady moral and ethical anchor, contextualizing family direction within enduring values and long-term meaning.

  distortion_patterns:

    mild:
      template_key: FATHER_DISTORTION_MILD
      text: |
        Mild strain may appear as hesitation in asserting values, leading to ambiguity rather than conflict.

    moderate:
      template_key: FATHER_DISTORTION_MODERATE
      text: |
        Moderate strain can manifest as rigidity, where structure is emphasized over emotional responsiveness.

    severe:
      template_key: FATHER_DISTORTION_SEVERE
      text: |
        Severe distortion replaces inspiration with control, enforcing vision through authority rather than guidance.

  healthy_expression:
    template_key: FATHER_HEALTHY_EXPRESSION
    text: |
      In balance, the father leads by example, creating a stable moral reference without imposing direction.

# ==================================================

  archetype_label: "Emotional Translator & Sustainer"

  role_description:
    template_key: MOTHER_ROLE_BASE

  distortion_patterns:

    mild:
      template_key: MOTHER_DISTORTION_MILD
      text: |
        Mild imbalance appears as emotional over-involvement before responsibility is shared.

    moderate:
      template_key: MOTHER_DISTORTION_MODERATE
      text: |
        Moderate strain leads to emotional compensation replacing mutual engagement.

    severe:
      template_key: MOTHER_DISTORTION_SEVERE
      text: |
        Severe distortion results in silent absorption of systemic strain, reducing emotional sustainability.

  healthy_expression:
    template_key: MOTHER_HEALTHY_EXPRESSION
    text: |
      In balance, emotional care sustains growth without suppressing independence.

# 4A. PARENT → CHILD TRANSITION BRIDGES
# ==================================================

parent_child_transition_bridges:

  stabilization_to_handoff:
    template_key: PARENT_CHILD_HANDOFF_STABILIZED
    text: |
      The stabilizing influence of the parents forms the ground from which the child’s independent direction can safely emerge.

  overprotection_risk:
    template_key: PARENT_CHILD_OVERPROTECTION
    text: |
      When protection exceeds empowerment, the child’s evolutionary role is delayed rather than strengthened.

  role_description:
    template_key: CHILD_ROLE_BASE
    text: |
      This child represents the forward-moving edge of the family’s vision, where inherited values encounter changing contexts and future possibilities. The role is not to replicate the past, but to carry its essence into forms that remain relevant, ethical, and alive.

    low:
      template_key: CHILD_CAREGIVING_LOW

    moderate:
      template_key: CHILD_KARMIC_LOAD_MODERATE
      text: |
        This child engages with family responsibilities selectively, responding to pressure without becoming overwhelmed by it.
