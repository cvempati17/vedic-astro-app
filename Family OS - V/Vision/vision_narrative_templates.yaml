        This family carries a deeply dharmic and emotionally rooted vision, centered on emotional security, moral integrity, and inner growth rather than outward dominance or material ambition alone.
      - |
        Alignment is present but requires conscious participation, especially as individual needs and expressions evolve.

# ==================================================
# 1A. FAMILY VISION — COMBINED VARIANTS
# ==================================================

family_vision_combined_variants:

  clarity_moderate__parent_dominant:
    template_key: FAMILY_VISION_MODERATE_PARENT_DOMINANT
    text: |
      While a shared vision exists, parental stabilization outweighs the child’s evolving expression, creating a need for conscious handoff rather than prolonged containment.

  clarity_moderate__child_conflicted:
    template_key: FAMILY_VISION_MODERATE_CHILD_CONFLICTED
    text: |
      The family’s vision is present but strained by tension between inherited expectations and the child’s emerging autonomy.

  clarity_low__emotional_overfunctioning:
    template_key: FAMILY_VISION_LOW_EMOTIONAL_OVERFUNCTIONING
    text: |
      Emotional effort temporarily substitutes for shared clarity, masking deeper misalignment within the family vision.

# ==================================================
# 2. FATHER — VISION ROLE
# ==================================================

father_vision_role:
  archetype_label: "Principle Holder & Moral Compass"

  role_description:
    template_key: FATHER_ROLE_BASE
    text: |
      The father’s vision role is to act as a steady moral and ethical anchor, contextualizing family direction within enduring values and long-term meaning.

  distortion_patterns:

    mild:
      template_key: FATHER_DISTORTION_MILD
      text: |
        Mild strain may appear as hesitation in asserting values, leading to ambiguity rather than conflict.

    moderate:
      template_key: FATHER_DISTORTION_MODERATE
      text: |
        Moderate strain can manifest as rigidity, where structure is emphasized over emotional responsiveness.

    severe:
      template_key: FATHER_DISTORTION_SEVERE
      text: |
        Severe distortion replaces inspiration with control, enforcing vision through authority rather than guidance.

  healthy_expression:
    template_key: FATHER_HEALTHY_EXPRESSION
    text: |
      In balance, the father leads by example, creating a stable moral reference without imposing direction.

# ==================================================
# 3. MOTHER — VISION ROLE
# ==================================================

mother_vision_role:
  archetype_label: "Emotional Translator & Sustainer"

  role_description:
    template_key: MOTHER_ROLE_BASE
    text: |
      The mother translates the family’s vision into lived emotional reality, ensuring belonging, care, and emotional continuity.

  distortion_patterns:

    mild:
      template_key: MOTHER_DISTORTION_MILD
      text: |
        Mild imbalance appears as emotional over-involvement before responsibility is shared.

    moderate:
      template_key: MOTHER_DISTORTION_MODERATE
      text: |
        Moderate strain leads to emotional compensation replacing mutual engagement.

    severe:
      template_key: MOTHER_DISTORTION_SEVERE
      text: |
        Severe distortion results in silent absorption of systemic strain, reducing emotional sustainability.

  healthy_expression:
    template_key: MOTHER_HEALTHY_EXPRESSION
    text: |
      In balance, emotional care sustains growth without suppressing independence.

# ==================================================
# 4. CHILD — VISION ROLE
# ==================================================

child_vision_role:
  archetype_label: "Future Direction Carrier"

  role_description:
    template_key: CHILD_ROLE_BASE
    text: |
      The child represents the evolutionary edge of the family’s vision, where inherited values meet emerging contexts.

  generational_modes:

    adaptive:
      template_key: CHILD_MODE_ADAPTIVE
      text: |
        Family wisdom is integrated with initiative, allowing organic evolution of vision.

    conflicted:
      template_key: CHILD_MODE_CONFLICTED
      text: |
        Tension arises between autonomy and inherited expectations, requiring conscious navigation.

    suppressed:
      template_key: CHILD_MODE_SUPPRESSED
      text: |
        Suppression limits the healthy evolution of the family’s direction.

  evolution_framing:
    template_key: CHILD_EVOLUTION_FRAMING
    text: |
      Fulfillment comes through integration, not imitation, of inherited wisdom.

# ==================================================
# 4A. PARENT → CHILD TRANSITION BRIDGES
# ==================================================

parent_child_transition_bridges:

  stabilization_to_handoff:
    template_key: PARENT_CHILD_HANDOFF_STABILIZED
    text: |
      The stabilizing influence of the parents forms the ground from which the child’s independent direction can safely emerge.

  overprotection_risk:
    template_key: PARENT_CHILD_OVERPROTECTION
    text: |
      When protection exceeds empowerment, the child’s evolutionary role is delayed rather than strengthened.
