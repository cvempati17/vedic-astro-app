    layer: responsibility_distribution
    purpose: >
      Defines how mission responsibilities are quantitatively and
      qualitatively distributed across family members, ensuring
      sustainability, fairness, and alignment with capacity.

      - 05_mission_planetary_strength_aspect_modifiers.yaml

  core_principles:
    - Responsibility must match capacity
    - No role is permanently overloaded
    - Distribution is dynamic, not fixed
    - Redistribution is a correction, not a failure
    - Collective sustainability overrides individual endurance

      for mission execution.

  enforcement_rules:
    - Any load above 40% on one member requires justification
    - Capacity_band_critical forces automatic redistribution
    - Sustainability_index below 60 triggers review
    - Chronic imbalance is a system failure, not a personal one

  usage_constraints:
    - This file must not override member_output_contract roles
    - Distribution decisions must remain reversible
    - Language must emphasize fairness and adaptability
