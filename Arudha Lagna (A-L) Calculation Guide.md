# Arudha Lagna (A-L) Calculation Guide

**Arudha Lagna** is a Vedic astrology concept that represents how the world perceives a person — the projection of one's physical self.

## 📌 How to Calculate Arudha Lagna (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Identify the Lagna Lord
Determine the ruling planet of the Ascendant (Lagna):
- Aries → Mars
- Taurus → Venus
- Gemini → Mercury
- Cancer → Moon
- Leo → Sun
- Virgo → Mercury
- Libra → Venus
- Scorpio → Mars/Ketu
- Sagittarius → Jupiter
- Capricorn → Saturn
- Aquarius → Saturn/Rahu
- Pisces → Jupiter

### 2️⃣ Find the House Position
Locate the house number where the Lagna lord is placed from the Lagna.

### 3️⃣ Count Forward the Same Number of Houses
From the house where the Lagna lord is placed, count the same number of houses forward to find **Arudha Lagna**.

## ✋ Special Conditions

📌 **If Lagna lord is in the 1st house:**  
- Arudha Lagna = **10th house** (not 1st house)

📌 **If Lagna lord is in the 7th house:**  
- Arudha Lagna = **4th house** (not 7th house)

📌 **General Rule:**  
If the result lands in the **same house** where the Lagna lord is located → shift **10 houses forward** instead.
