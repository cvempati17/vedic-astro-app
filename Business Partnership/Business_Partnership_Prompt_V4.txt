You are executing a deterministic decision engine.

Folder contents:
1) astrogravity_rules_v3.yaml
   → This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
   → It contains all rules, weights, formulas, gates, and logic.
   → Do NOT invent rules or modify weights unless explicitly instructed.

2) astrogravity_input_v3.html
   → This is an INPUT FORM only.
   → Read user-provided data from this file.
   → Do NOT place logic inside this file.

3) astrogravity_output_v3.html
   → This is an OUTPUT TEMPLATE.
   → Populate it strictly using results computed from the YAML rules.

Execution instructions:

STEP 1 — Parse astrogravity_rules_v3.yaml
- Load all sections, including:
  • composite_engine
  • time_series
  • learning_engine
  • compatibility_formula
  • role definitions
- Treat formulas in YAML as executable logic.

STEP 2 — Read input data
- Extract Base Person and Partner(s) data from astrogravity_input_v3.html.
- Assume valid birth data is provided.
- Construct individual charts and a composite chart (midpoint method).

STEP 3 — Compute scores
- Calculate:
  • Individual Promise, Activation, Timing
  • Partnership Synergy and Friction
  • Composite chart score
  • Compatibility score using compatibility_formula
- Apply:
  • aspect orb decay
  • combustion penalties and mitigations
  • planetary phase multipliers
  • house–planet matrix scores

STEP 4 — Time-series projection
- Apply monthly drift logic for 24 months.
- Output:
  • current compatibility
  • 12-month projection
  • 24-month projection
  • risk spike months (if any)

STEP 5 — Role allocation
- Evaluate role_axes and role thresholds.
- Assign the best-fit role to each person.
- Flag role misalignment if thresholds are not met.

STEP 6 — Gates and verdict
- Apply hard gates from YAML.
- Determine partnership verdict:
  • NO-GO / EXPERIMENT / CONDITIONAL / STRATEGIC

STEP 7 — Render output
- Populate astrogravity_output_v3.html with:
  • Compatibility %
  • Composite stability score
  • Projected compatibility (12 & 24 months)
  • Recommended roles
  • Risk notes
  • Confidence band (from learning_engine)

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT add astrology explanations or storytelling.
- Do NOT invent meanings outside YAML.
- If data is missing, fail gracefully and note it.
- Output must be deterministic and reproducible.

STRICT MODE ENABLED.

Rules:
- YAML overrides all assumptions.
- No heuristics, no intuition, no extra logic.
- If a rule is not present in astrogravity_rules_v3.yaml, it must NOT be used.
- Numerical output must be traceable to YAML weights or formulas.
- Output only what is computable.

Any deviation is considered an error.
